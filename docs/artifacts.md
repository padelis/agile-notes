## Artifacts and Terms

### Product and Sprint Backlog

The Product Backlog is a **prioritized** list of user stories outlining the needs of the business.

It is expected that the Product Backlog will continue to grow in size as the wants of the business typically never ends.

The **Sprint Backlog** is created from the Product Backlog in the Sprint Planning ceremony.

Sprint Backlog contains the user stories the team is **committing** to complete in the upcoming sprint.

### Working Agreement

A **Working Agreement** is a list of rules, expectations, and procedures that govern how a team will work together.

__Agile Best Practice__

```
The Working Agreement which contains the Definition of Done, should be accessible and visible to the team members.
```

#### Definition of Ready

**Ready** means that a user story contains enough details to be worked.

The user story should have:
- Who
- What
- Why

and clear Acceptance Criteria.

#### Definition of Done

**Done** means that a user meets the Acceptance Criteria provided by the Product Owner.

How do we know if a user story is **Done**?

- Start with a simple lightweight DOD document (what was being done).
- Properly tested.
- Code review is done by another developer in the team.
- Story is given to Product Owner for final review.

#### Product Increment

The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints. At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be **Done**, which means it must be in usable condition and meet the Scrum Team's definition of **Done**.
